        <h2>
            My Name is Melaati Jayah. I was born in Colombo Sri-Lanka which is an island
            south of India. Sri-Lanka is also known as "The Tear Drop Of India" because of its shape and size. I came
            with my parents and my older brother to the United States at a very young age of 4. Memphis TN has been my
            home and where I was raised. At a young age I grew love for technology. When my hands touch the key board, and I
            turned on my computer screen, It was another world. I went from restaurant manager to software developer, from
            service to development. I have learned from so many and my passion to continue learning never stops. I plan on
            bringing Memphis my love for tech, my love for problem solving, and my skills ive gained on the way of my journey
            to this day.
